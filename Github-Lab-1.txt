Github Lab 1: Collaboration

Instructions: In this lab we will play a game of literary ‘exquisite corpse’. The idea is we will write a story where each student writes one paragraph of the story based on the last paragraph. 

For this assignment please edit this file by opening it into a text program like TextEdit / Microsoft Word. Please keep the story PG. No use of cursing, racism, sexist, homophobia, intense graphic violence imagery, overt sexual speech will be tolerated. When you start your paragraph please write your name at the top.

When you are done with the paragraph please separate your section by using the a line of underscores. You can do this by holding shift + hypen (-)

She must have sleep walked again, she had never ended up in a place with so many tall buildings. She needed to find shelter soon, figuring she could return home in the morning.

She started running towards the magical forest. At the end of the forest there was a huge waterfall and she could not figure out how to get to the bottom of the waterfall.She realized the sunset was coming and she didn't have an  idea but suddenly .....

---------

A spaceship appears. It was large and shiny and playing 'La Bamba' at a high pitched sounded.

-- David Hurwich

She jumped into the spaceship and beamed off into outer space. She looked very forward to making new friends. 

-- I-Ting Shen 

Once the darkness of space closed around her, the gorilla named Esme, desperately hoped to time travel.  Her native city of San Francisco no longer seemed a friendly place for a female gorilla, despite the fact that Diane Fossey of “Gorillas in the mist” graduated from Lowell - the most despised, yet respected high school in San Francisco.  But, thought Esme to herself, so did Daniel Handler, and we all know how happy he turned out to be.

Soon, Esme became extremely useful to the alien crew. Her ability to multitask using both hands and feet amazed them!

They realized that they were close to Venus but there was some problems with the engine, so the alien could not turn around.

Fortunately, someone on the ship knew a trick to use the planet's gravity to slingshot the ship back home.

-Sarah Cintron
-------------------

But the trajectory was miscalculated and they were shot out far beyond earth and after 200 parsecs landed on a strange foreign planet...

Looks the like the alien species know the humans are referring to them

Esme and her crew try to persuade the natives that they mean no harm. They explain they just need to recharge and refuel. 

-Jeanette Paak

-------------------------------------

Esme soon realized that the natives had no concept of the fuel they needed for the ship. The crew and her were stranded on a primitive native planet the natives called, Urrgurrl.
